# The cache parameter is here for if you want to implement
# a solution that is more efficient than the naive
# recursive solution


# This solution actually works for larger ns, but I wrote not to accept a cache as an argument (which I think is better than requiring a cache). However, the tests in test_eating_cookies.py _do_ pass in a cache, which breaks my code. I added two lines to reject the incoming cache.

    # The following two lines reject any cache passed in as an argument:
    if cache[0] == 0:

    if n in cache:
        return cache[n]
    else:
        cache[n] = eating_cookies(n - 1, cache) + \
            eating_cookies(n - 2, cache) + eating_cookies(n - 3, cache)
        return cache[n]
